version 0.0.7 was minor and "internal" (not saved to GitHub) - functionally same as 0.0.6
creating version 0.0.6
removing boot info from nanopk and creating uptime()

***********
Reminders / notes to self / installation notes.

I can't test directly from this directory because the previous version is already installed.  
build.sh creates the temporary build in /tmp/npk
Go to that directory and make again if needed and the sudo make install
Then run test.php
Need to restart Apache to test web version

My 2017 random web app is the only app on my web site that uses this so far.  It works 
seamlessly with 0.0.7
